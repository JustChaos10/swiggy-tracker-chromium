## Recent Fixes

### Chart.js CSP Issue (Fixed)
- **Problem**: Charts were failing to load due to Content Security Policy violations when loading Chart.js from external CDNs
- **Solution**: Bundled Chart.js directly with the extension and created a fallback implementation
- **Result**: Charts now load reliably without external dependencies

### Error Handling Improvements
- Added robust error handling for chart generation
- Implemented fallback chart rendering when Chart.js fails to load
- Better null reference protection in chart UI components

## Configuration

### Groq API (Optional)
For enhanced chart generation, you can configure the Groq API:

1. Get a free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Open `background.js` and replace the `API_KEY` value
3. The extension will use local chart generation as fallback if API is unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### Charts Not Loading
- Ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled
- Refresh the Swiggy page and try again
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- The extension includes fallback chart rendering if Chart.js fails

### No Data Showing
- Make sure you're logged into Swiggy
- Navigate to your order history page
- Use the "FULL SYNC" button to manually sync orders
- Check that you have orders in your Swiggy account

### Extension Not Working
- Disable and re-enable the extension
- Clear browser cache and cookies for Swiggy
- Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium-based browsers)

## Privacy

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers (except optional Groq API calls)
- You can clear all data using the "CLEAR DATA" button

## Development

The extension consists of several key files:

- `content.js`: Main content script that scrapes order data
- `charts-ui.js`: Chart rendering and UI components
- `chart-generator.js`: Chart data generation logic
- `storage.js`: Local data storage management
- `background.js`: Service worker for API proxying
- `chart.js`: Bundled Chart.js library
